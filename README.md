## CI/CD Tools and Practices Final Project Template

## Setup

After entering the lab environment you will need to run the `setup.sh` script in the `./bin` folder to install the prerequisite software.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phanhai78/ci-final-project
cd ci-final-project
bash bin/setup.sh
```

Then you must exit the shell and start a new one for the Python virtual environment to be activated.

```bash
exit
```
Open **New Terminal** 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make all
```
